                    <p>
                        King Kong vs. Godzilla (Japanese: キングコング対ゴジラ, Hepburn: Kingu Kongu tai Gojira) is a 1962
                        Japanese kaiju film directed by Ishirō Honda, with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. Produced
                        and distributed by Toho Co., Ltd, it is the third film in both the Godzilla and King Kong
                        franchises, as well as the first Toho-produced film featuring King Kong. It is also the first
                        time that each character appeared on film in color and widescreen.[5] The film stars Shoichi
                        Hirose as King Kong and Haruo Nakajima as Godzilla with Shoichi Hirose, Tadao Takashima, Kenji
                        Sahara, Yū Fujiki, Ichirō Arishima, and Mie Hama playing other prominent roles. In the film,
                        Godzilla is reawakened by an American submarine and a pharmaceutical company captures King Kong
                        for promotional uses, culminating in a battle on Mount Fuji.
                        <br><br>
                        The project began with a story outline devised by King Kong stop motion animator Willis O'Brien
                        around 1960, in which Kong battles a giant Frankenstein's monster; O'Brien gave the outline to
                        producer John Beck for development. Behind O'Brien's back and without his knowledge, Beck gave
                        the project to Toho to produce the film, replacing the giant Frankenstein's monster with
                        Godzilla and scrapping O'Brien's original story.[6]
                        <br><br>
                        King Kong vs. Godzilla was released theatrically in Japan on August 11, 1962, and grossed ¥352
                        million, making it the second-highest-grossing Japanese film in history upon its release. The
                        film remains the most attended Godzilla film in Japan to date,[7] and is credited with
                        encouraging Toho to prioritize the continuation of the Godzilla series after seven years of
                        dormancy. A heavily re-edited "Americanized" version of the film was released theatrically in
                        the United States by Universal International Inc. on June 26, 1963 as Universal's first King
                        Kong film, the second being King Kong Escapes on June 19, 1968, and the third being the second
                        remake of the 1933 film on December 14, 2005.
                        <br><br>
                        The film was followed by Mothra vs. Godzilla, released on April 29, 1964.

                                <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
                                <p>Although fans of both Kong and Godzilla argue to this day, Toho has declared that King Kong was meant to win. Kong was much more popular than Godzilla at this time, and was the obvious choice to win audiences over.

                        <h3>Plot</h3>
                        <p>Mr. Tako, head of Pacific Pharmaceuticals, is frustrated with the television shows his
                            company is sponsoring and wants something to boost his ratings. When a doctor tells Tako
                            about a giant monster he discovered on the small Faro Island, Tako believes that it would be
                            a brilliant idea to use the monster to gain publicity. Tako sends two men, Osamu Sakurai and
                            Kinsaburo Furue, to find and bring back the monster. Meanwhile, the American nuclear
                            submarine Seahawk gets caught in an iceberg. The iceberg collapses, unleashing Godzilla, who
                            had been trapped within it since 1955.[note 2] Godzilla destroys the submarine and makes its
                            way towards Japan, attacking a military base as it journeys southward.
                            <br><br>
                            On Faro Island, a gigantic octopus crawls ashore and attacks the native village in search of
                            Farolacton juice, taken from a species of red berry native to the island. The mysterious
                            Faro monster, revealed to be King Kong, arrives and defeats the octopus. Kong drinks several
                            vases full of the juice while the islanders perform a ceremony, which causes him to fall
                            asleep. Sakurai and Furue place Kong on a large raft and begin to transport him back to
                            Japan. Mr. Tako arrives on the ship transporting Kong, but a JSDF ship stops them and orders
                            that Kong must be kept out of Japan. Meanwhile, Godzilla arrives in Japan and terrorizes the
                            countryside. Kong wakes up and breaks free from the raft. Reaching the mainland, Kong
                            confronts Godzilla and proceeds to throw giant rocks at him. Godzilla is not fazed by King
                            Kong's rock attack and uses its heat ray to burn him. Kong retreats after realizing that he
                            is not yet ready to take on Godzilla.
                            <br><br>
                            The JSDF digs a large pit laden with explosives and poison gas and lures Godzilla into it,
                            but Godzilla is unharmed. They next string up a barrier of power lines around the city
                            filled with 1,000,000 volts of electricity, which proves effective against Godzilla. Kong
                            approaches Tokyo and tears through the power lines, feeding off the electricity, which seems
                            to make Kong stronger. Kong then enters Tokyo and captures Fumiko, Sakurai's sister, taking
                            her to the National Diet Building which he then scales. The JSDF launches capsules full of
                            vaporised Farolacton juice, which puts Kong to sleep, and rescue Fumiko. The JSDF decides to
                            transport Kong via balloons to Godzilla, in hopes that they will kill each other.
                            <br><br>
                            The next morning, Kong is deployed by helicopters next to Godzilla at the summit of Mount
                            Fuji and the two engage in battle. Godzilla initially has the advantage, dazing Kong with a
                            devastating dropkick and repeated tail blows to his head. Godzilla attempts to burn Kong to
                            death by using its atomic breath to set fire to the foliage around Kong's body. A bolt of
                            lightning from thunder clouds strikes Kong, reviving him and charging him up, and the battle
                            resumes. Godzilla and King Kong fight their way down the mountain and into Atami, where the
                            two monsters destroy Atami Castle while trading blows, before falling off a cliff together
                            into Sagami Bay. After a brief underwater battle, only Kong resurfaces from the water, and
                            he swims back toward his home island. There is no sign of Godzilla, but the JSDF speculates
                            that it may have survived.
