                    <h3>Folklore & Mythology</h3>
                    <p>In order to understand the success and longstanding popularity of Kaiju films in Japan, we must
                        examine the cultural context of the country. With something so prominent and recognizable to
                        Japan it is likely that parallels between Kaiju film and Japanese culture allow it to overcome
                        the obstacles of time and popular trends. This parallel can be found in Japanese mythology and
                        religion particularly Shinto, an ethnic religion as old as the country itself.
                        <br><br>
                        Shinto, unlike Buddhism, the other major religion of the country, was founded in Japan and the
                        myths, creatures, and people of Shinto remain popular among the entire population in the same
                        way that Greek myths and fairy tales are so recognizable in Europe and North America. Shinto is
                        a polytheistic religion that gives anthropomorphic qualities to abstract ideas like nature and
                        emotions. Because of this association, many of the deities and creatures within Shinto represent
                        large, unstoppable forces that are outside of the capacity for humans to control. There are
                        numerous creatures, monsters, and spirits, often known as Yokai, within Shinto and many are
                        listed within an illustrative collection known as the Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki. Inside this, we
                        notice many recognizable and obscure creatures such as the Shisa, Basan and Waira as well as
                        creatures within broader categories such as Dragons and Oni.

                                <p>The Japanese word kaijū originally referred to monsters and creatures from ancient
                                    Japanese legends; it earlier appeared in the Chinese Classic of Mountains and Seas.
                                </p>

                        <p>
                            Many of these creatures represent abstract ideas such as hope, fire, evil and thunder.
                            Because these creatures represent such uncontrollable forces of nature stories involving
                            them often contain tales of destruction or creation. Many of these folk creatures also share
                            behavioral and aesthetic similarities with modern Kaiju; many special effects artists
                            attribute their inspiration to Shinto legends.

                        <h3>Kaijus in Films</h3>
                        <p>A large number of Kaiju films deal with the struggle of the military to combat the threat of
                            Kaiju, often in vain, and the only force that can stop one is another Kaiju. This gives
                            these monsters a godly sense to them, while humans cannot fight the destruction another hero
                            monster will come as an almost divine protector. The reason it would appear that Kaiju films
                            strike such a chord with Japanese people is that it often pays tribute and draws themes from
                            traditional mythological elements of the culture that have been celebrated since childhood.
                            The reason many Japanese Kaiju films are not as widely popular worldwide is because they
                            were not created with international audiences in mind. kaiju films become a new-age
                            mythology, one that borrows from the old and presents it in a modern way within a new
                            medium. Therefore one of the major reasons Kaiju films are so associated and popular within
                            Japan is because it is a direct emulation of the country’s cultural roots, the people adopt
                            it for its familiarity and celebrate it for the new entertaining aspects it presents.
                            <br><br>
                            One of the most fundamental reasons as to why Kaiju films, or specifically the Godzilla
                            franchise, has grown to such popularity amongst the citizens of Japan is a result of its
                            position during the second World War. After World War II the country was in shock from the
                            devastating nuclear attacks carried out on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
                            <br><br>
                            What the director of the original Godzilla sought to do almost a decade later was capture
                            the public’s feelings and display the dangers of nuclear war. Godzilla himself was a
                            creature birthed from nuclear radiation and he becomes an unstoppable force of nature
                            leaving nothing but a wake of destruction. This is why the original Godzilla carries a much
                            more serious tone than its sequels and focuses heavily on the military efforts to stop
                            Godzilla. Godzilla struck a chord with the general public and helped them keep the
                            catastrophe, still relatively recent, and the people who suffered in their hearts. While the
                            rest of the world simply saw a monster movie starring a man in a rubber suit the people of
                            Japan saw an allegory of nuclear war and an homage to all the innocent people that lost
                            their lives. The success of the original film allowed it to be a stepping stone for all
                            styles of Kaiju films, now that Kaiju was becoming a popular genre Toho began to dominate
                            their production well throughout the next 80 years. Toho continually produced Godzilla films
                            after this but also experimented with other monsters and thematic decisions. Godzilla has
                            continued to represent these themes semi-regularly, and while the franchise will explore
                            styles it continually returns to its representational roots. In its most recent adaptation
                            Shin Godzilla after Toho’s hiatus of more than a decade, the film very much acted as an
                            homage to the original film, and the critics and the general public of Japan recognized
                            this.

                                    <p>The term kaijū translates literally as "strange beast". Kaiju can be antagonistic, protagonistic, or a neutral force of nature, but are more specifically preternatural creatures of divine power.

                            <h3>Tokusatsu</h3>
                            <p>Kaiju films may seem large enough to be its own genre of television and film but in actuality, it is a niche sub-genre of a much larger mother genre popular in Japan since the early 1900’s known as Tokusatsu.  Tokusatsu is a form of live action film known for its considerable use of special effects, usually practical and is more of a stylistic description than a thematic one.  While Tokusatsu deals with many genres such as horror, sci-fi, fantasy and drama the two genres most associated with it, and often combined together, are superhero and Kaiju.  Superhero Tokusatsu was created at nearly the same time as the first Japanese Kaiju film but was designed for television and younger children so the budgets are typically smaller yet the shows carry larger audiences.  Before discussing the first tokusatsu television we must examine feudal Japan where the origins of Tokusatsu lie.

                            <h3>Kabuki</h3>
                            <p>Before discussing the first tokusatsu television we must examine feudal Japan where the roots of Tokusatsu are found.  Tokusatsu is often considered an evolution of traditional Japanese Kabuki and Bunraku, forms of Japanese theater that relied on extravagant costumes and makeup, stylized drama, puppetry and dance to tell action fueled stories inspired heavily by mythological characters.
                                <br><br>
                                Kabuki’s trademarks of flamboyancy and elaborate visuals remained consistent aspects of its style even into the modern day and many elements of its design influence the modern Tokusatsu.  Kabuki saw its popularity extend from the early 1600s into the mid-1800’s.  After the Meiji period and Japan’s introduction to the West, Kabuki saw a substantial reemergence, it became a tool the people used to hold on to their culture in a time of large change and adaptation to new cultures.  It was not until WWII that Kabuki was briefly banned by occupied forces and afterwards it was rejected as a relic of the past and a hindrance towards modernization.  While Kabuki in modern day is once again the most popular form of theater in Japan, with many Kabuki actors working in film and television, its brief rejection during the mid 1900’s allowed Tokusatsu to gain foothold using similar techniques.  Nowadays Kabuki and Tokusatusu, despite influences and similarities, both exist in conjunction with each other as popular forms of entertainment for entirely unique audiences.
