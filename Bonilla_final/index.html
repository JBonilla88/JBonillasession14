                    <h3>What are they?</h3>
                    <p>Kaiju is a Japanese term that is commonly associated with media involving giant monsters. A
                        subgenre of science-fiction, more precisely monster films, its widespread contemporary use is
                        credited to tokusatsu (special effects) director Eiji Tsuburaya and filmmaker Ishirō Honda, who
                        popularized the kaiju film genre by creating the Godzilla franchise and its spin-offs. The term
                        can also refer to the monsters themselves, which are usually depicted attacking major
                        cities, and battling either the military or other creatures. Kaiju are monstrous creatures that
                        come in different sizes and shapes. All of them have different features, some more humanoid than
                        others. Every kaiju possess a Core (核, Kaku), which is their vital organ and weakness, inside
                        their body, and since every kaiju comes in a different type the location of the core changes
                        accordingly.

                                <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
                                <p>Every Kaiju is given a Fortitude level (フォルティチュード, Forutichūdo) which is a way for
                                    the Defense Force to measure the creature's power and its potential threat to
                                    humanity.[5] According to the Fortitude level, Kaiju are then classified power-wise.

                        <h3>Abilities</h3>
                        <p>
                            All kaiju gain their powers from their Uni-organ (ユニ器官, Yuni-kikan), an organ containing
                            their specific powers. Despite their common nature, each kaiju possesses different abilities
                            and powers, so it's quite rare to find similar kaiju. Some powers most kaiju have in common
                            are super strength, proliferation abilities, and great fortitude levels. Some of them are
                            able to fly[1] and the most complex are even able to practice human language and, through
                            that, can talk.

                        <h3>Types of Kaijus</h3>
                        <p>Yoju (余よ獣じゅう, Yojū, lit. "Residual Beast") are smaller kaiju who accompany their Honju. There
                            are
                            usually numerous Yoju to assist a Honju, and some kind of Yoju can have proliferative organs
                            as
                            well. Yoju can appear in many ways, by traveling routes made by the Honju, latching onto the
                            Honju, being created by the Honju, and more. Some Yoju can have a fortitude number above
                            6.0,
                            thus being a Honju-level threat while still being a Yoju.
                            <br><br>
                            Honju (本ホン獣じゅう, Honjū, lit. "Main Beast") are usually the biggest and most powerful kaiju,
                            and
                            the one who generates and guides all the other Yoju through their proliferative organs.
                            Their
                            fortitude level is usually above 6.0. A Honju with a fortitude level of 6.4 would require an
                            entire Platoon of Defense Force soldiers to defeat it, and only a Captain or Vice-Captain
                            could
                            defeat one alone.
                            <br><br>
                            Daikaiju (大だい怪かい獣じゅう, Daikaijū, lit. "Large Monster") is a special category of kaiju. It is
                            the
                            name given to particularly strong kaiju, whose fortitude level exceeds the number 8.0.
                            Having
                            appeared ever since the Meireki era, these kinds of kaiju are part of the strongest
                            category,
                            with their power not necessarily being linked to their size, since Kafka, who has a
                            fortitude
                            level of 9.8 in his kaiju form, the highest seen thus far in the series, defeated multiple
                            kaiju
                            much larger than him in size. Due to their incredible power, Daikaiju can also be Honju and
                            guide their group of Yoju (like Kaiju No. 10 with the Preondactyl Kaiju).[10] In spite of
                            that,
                            Daikaiju are not above operating individually on their own. According to Isao Shinomiya, the
                            Defense Force presently has around two dozen elite officers who stand a chance at taking on
                            a
                            Daikaiju, less than ten in single-combat and when fighting a numbered Daikaiju, the number
                            gets
                            even lower.
                            <br><br>
                            Identified Kaiju (識しき別べつ怪かい獣じゅう, Shikibetsu Kaijū) are daikaiju that are extremely powerful
                            and
                            have a fortitude level of 9.0 or higher. Even if their fortitude level is lower than 9.0
                            (like
                            Kaiju No. 9, who had a fortitude level of 8.5 before shedding its skin), if there is a need
                            for
                            identification, then a codename will be given. While daikaiju of this caliber have always
                            appeared in history, their identification numbers were implemented only after the fortitude
                            observation system was established.

                                    <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
                                    <p>Kaiju has been theorized as being born from the immense energy produced by the
                                        faults
                                        in the earth, acting upon the underground substances, plants, and animals to
                                        produce
                                        them.[36] It was further elaborated as the Mysterious Larva was born from the
                                        "Dragon Veins" deep within the earth after the hearts of the warriors formed a
                                        core

                            <h3></h3>
                            <p>The Kaiju themselves vary wildly in size, anywhere from 20 to 500 feet. Their bodies are
                                typically an amalgam of reptilian, cephalopod and ichthyological traits. Nearly all
                                Kaiju
                                observed to date are pentaradially symmetrical, with body parts that typically come in
                                pairs
                                instead coming in sets of five.
                                <br><br>
                                The Kaiju have been observed to be highly aggressive, attacking most other entities on
                                sight
                                as well as frequently battling each other. Although spectacular, these fights are rarely
                                fatal as Kaiju possess both supernatural durability and regenerative abilities. They
                                also
                                possess a variety of offensive thaumaturgical abilities as well, such as being able to
                                exhale spellfire that does not extinguish underwater.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <section>
                            <p>The exact population of Kaiju is unknown, but as they have yet to deplete their primary
                                food
                                source, it appears that the Kaiju kill significantly fewer whales than Humans did during
                                the
                                era of industrial whaling. Given both the size and aggressive nature of the Kaiju, this
                                is
                                somewhat perplexing.
                                <br><br>
                                In addition to the problem of food, the colossal size of the Kaiju clearly violates the
                                square-cube law, as well as introducing a variety of other scale related problems. In
                                addition to possessing extensive non-Euclidean biology and abnormally thaumaturgically
                                active cells, the Kaiju have a relatively low internal Hume value, lessening the effect
                                of
                                our reality's laws of physics on its body.
