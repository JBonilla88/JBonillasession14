					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>
						Godzilla (Japanese: ゴジラ, Hepburn: Gojira) is a 1954 Japanese epic kaiju film directed and
						co-written by Ishirō Honda, with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. Produced and distributed by
						Toho, it is the first film in the Godzilla franchise. The film stars Akira Takarada, Momoko
						Kōchi, Akihiko Hirata, Takashi Shimura, with Haruo Nakajima and Katsumi Tezuka as Godzilla. In
						the film, Japan's authorities deal with the sudden appearance of a giant monster, whose attacks
						trigger fears of nuclear holocaust in post-war Japan.

						Godzilla entered production after a Japanese-Indonesian co-production collapsed. Tsuburaya
						originally proposed a giant octopus before the filmmakers decided on a dinosaur-inspired
						creature. Godzilla pioneered a form of special effects called suitmation in which a stunt
						performer wearing a suit interacts with miniature sets. Principal photography ran 51 days, and
						special effects photography ran 71 days.
						<br><br>
						Godzilla premiered in Nagoya on October 27, 1954, and received a wide release in Japan on
						November 3. It was met with mixed reviews upon release but was a box-office success, winning the
						Japanese Movie Association Award for Best Special Effects. The film earned ¥183 million in
						distributor rentals, making it the eighth-highest-grossing Japanese film of that year. In 1956,
						a heavily re-edited "Americanized" version, titled Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, was released
						in the United States.
						<br><br>
						The film spawned a multimedia franchise that was recognized by Guinness World Records as the
						longest-running film franchise in history. The character Godzilla has since become an
						international popular culture icon. The film and Tsuburaya have been largely credited for
						establishing the template for tokusatsu media. The film received reappraisal in later years and
						has since been regarded as one of the best monster films ever made. The film was followed by the
						sequel Godzilla Raids Again.

								<h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
								<p>The monster suit, worn by actor Haruo Nakajima, weighed approximately 200 lbs (90 kg)
									or more. Inside the suit, temperatures reportedly reached up to 60 °C (140 °F) under
									the hot studio lights.

						<h3>Plot</h3>
						<p>In 1954, after the Japanese freighter Eiko-maru is destroyed near Odo Island, another
							ship—the Bingo-maru—is sent to investigate, only to meet the same fate with few survivors. A
							fishing boat from Odo is also destroyed, with one survivor. Fishing catches mysteriously
							drop to zero, blamed by an elder on the ancient sea creature known as "Godzilla". Reporters
							arrive on Odo Island to further investigate. A villager tells one of the reporters that
							something in the sea is ruining the fishing. That evening, a storm strikes the island,
							destroying the reporters' helicopter, and Godzilla, briefly seen, destroys 17 homes, kills
							nine people, and kills 20 of the villagers' livestock.
							<br><br>
							Odo residents travel to Tokyo to demand disaster relief. The villagers' and reporters'
							evidence describes damage consistent with something large crushing the village. The
							government sends paleontologist Kyohei Yamane to investigate the island, where giant
							radioactive footprints and a trilobite are discovered. The village alarm bell is rung, and
							Yamane and the villagers rush to see the monster, retreating after seeing it is a giant
							dinosaur. Yamane presents his findings in Tokyo, estimating that Godzilla is 50 meters (160
							ft) tall and has evolved from an ancient sea creature, becoming a terrestrial creature. He
							concludes that Godzilla has been disturbed by underwater hydrogen bomb testing. Debate
							ensues about notifying the public about the danger of the monster. Meanwhile, 17 ships are
							lost at sea.
							<br><br>
							Ten frigates are dispatched to attempt to kill the monster using depth charges. The mission
							disappoints Yamane, who wants Godzilla to be studied. When Godzilla survives the attack,
							officials appeal to Yamane for ideas on how to kill the monster. Still, Yamane tells them
							that Godzilla is unkillable, having survived H-bomb testing, and that it must be studied.
							Yamane's daughter, Emiko, decides to break off her arranged engagement to Yamane's
							colleague, Daisuke Serizawa, because of her love for Hideto Ogata, a salvage ship captain.
							When a reporter arrives and asks to interview Serizawa, Emiko escorts the reporter to
							Serizawa's home. After Serizawa refuses to divulge his current work to the reporter, he
							gives Emiko a demonstration of his recent project on the condition that she must keep it a
							secret. The demonstration horrifies her, and she leaves without mentioning the engagement.
							Shortly after she returns home, Godzilla surfaces from Tokyo Bay and attacks Shinagawa.
							After attacking a passing train, Godzilla returns to the ocean.
							<br><br>
							After consulting international experts, the Japan Self-Defense Forces constructs a 30 meters
							(98 ft) tall and 50,000 volt electrified fence along the coast and deploys forces to kill
							Godzilla. Dismayed that there is no plan to study Godzilla for its resistance to radiation,
							Yamane returns home, where Emiko and Ogata await, hoping to get his consent for them to wed.
							When Ogata disagrees with Yamane, arguing that Godzilla's threat outweighs any potential
							benefits from studying the monster, Yamane tells him to leave. Godzilla resurfaces and
							breaks through the fence to Tokyo with its atomic breath, unleashing more destruction across
							the city. Further attempts to kill the monster with tanks and fighter jets fail, and
							Godzilla returns to the ocean. The day after, hospitals and shelters are crowded with the
							maimed and the dead, with some survivors suffering from radiation sickness.
							<br><br>
							Distraught by the devastation, Emiko tells Ogata about Serizawa's research, a weapon called
							the "Oxygen Destroyer", which disintegrates oxygen atoms and causes organisms to asphyxiate,
							then dissolve, leaving nothing behind. Emiko and Ogata go to Serizawa to convince him to use
							the Oxygen Destroyer. Still, he initially refuses, explaining that if he uses the device,
							the world's superpowers will force him to construct more Oxygen Destroyers as a superweapon.
							After watching a program displaying the nation's current tragedy, Serizawa finally accepts
							their pleas. As Serizawa burns his notes, Emiko breaks down crying.
							<br><br>
							A navy ship takes Ogata and Serizawa to plant the device in Tokyo Bay. After finding
							Godzilla, Serizawa activates the device and cuts off his air supply, taking the secret of
							the Oxygen Destroyer to his grave. The Oxygen Destroyer successfully kills Godzilla and
							disintegrates its body; many mourn Serizawa's death. Yamane believes that if nuclear weapons
							testing continues, another Godzilla may rise in the future.
